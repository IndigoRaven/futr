# Kardashev Scale

The Kardashev Scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy they are able to harness.
Originally proposed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1964, the scale has three designated categories:

## Type I Civilization
A Type I civilization, often referred to as a "planetary civilization," can harness and store all of the energy available on its home planet.

## Type II Civilization
A Type II civilization, termed a "stellar civilization," can harness the total energy of its star (like capturing the energy of the Sun with a Dyson Sphere).

## Type III Civilization
A Type III civilization, known as a "galactic civilization," can control energy on the scale of its entire galaxy.

## Carl Sagan's Refined Kardashev Scale

Carl Sagan, the renowned astrophysicist and cosmologist, introduced a nuanced interpretation of the Kardashev Scale, offering a more granular approach to measuring a civilization's technological advancement.

1. **Formulaic Approach**: Sagan's method involved a formulaic interpolation of the original Kardashev designations. Instead of the vast jumps between the types, he proposed that energy consumption grows in a more linear fashion.

2. **Earth's Position**: Using Sagan's refined scale, Earth's civilization would be classified as approximately 0.7. This suggests that we are on our way towards achieving the energy consumption of a Type I civilization but are not there yet.

3. **Intermediate Values**: The introduction of intermediate values, like the 0.7 designation for Earth, allows for a more precise understanding of a civilization's energy capabilities. It acknowledges the gradual progression of technological and energy advancements rather than vast categorical leaps.

4. **Future Potential**: Sagan's refinement implies that civilizations can progress through the scale at smaller increments, offering a roadmap for potential future advancements. It provides a more optimistic view, suggesting that even small advancements in energy harnessing can move a civilization closer to the next major Kardashev designation.

By adding these intermediate steps, Sagan's refined scale offers a more detailed and approachable understanding of a civilization's progression in terms of energy harnessing and technological advancement.

## Extension
Over time, other theorists have extended the scale to include even higher levels of energy manipulation, but the original three types remain the most widely discussed.
