# Number of Planets

Using the "number of planets" as a metric offers a straightforward way to gauge a civilization's growth, territorial influence, and resource potential in a fictional universe. 
This approach provides clarity, represents tangible expansion, and implies access to diverse habitats, cultures, and resources. 
Additionally, controlling multiple planets can offer strategic advantages, stimulate economic growth through interplanetary trade, and ensure a civilization's survival by providing redundancy against catastrophic events. 
However, it's essential to consider the qualitative differences between planets to get a comprehensive understanding of a civilization's true influence and capabilities.

In a fictional universe, using the metric "number of planets" to gauge the expanse or influence of a civilization can be a tempting approach. 
It offers a tangible, countable measure that seems straightforward. However, this metric presents several challenges:

1. Variability in Inhabitants: One of the primary issues is the vast difference in the number of inhabitants a planet might support. A civilization might control a large number of planets, but if each planet only houses a small population, its actual influence or power might be less than a civilization that controls fewer, but more densely populated, planets.
2. Diverse Planetary Conditions: Not all planets are created equal. Some might be resource-rich, offering vast wealth and strategic advantages, while others might be barren or primarily serve as outposts. Simply counting planets doesn't account for their individual value or strategic importance.
3. Alternative Celestial Bodies: Depending on the properties of the universe, planets might not be the only or even the primary celestial bodies of interest. Moons, asteroids, or even artificial space habitats might be just as crucial, if not more so, for a civilization's expansion and survival.
4. Universe's Properties: In some fictional settings, the very nature of space and planets might differ from our understanding. There might be universes where inter-dimensional realms, floating islands in space, or vast cosmic entities play a more significant role than planets.
